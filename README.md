# Jsdg

This gem will help poor SFEDU students to generate pdf-reports with Java files from MUAM

Due to the limited documentation, this is avaliable only in english language, so, please, don't use other languages

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add jsdg

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install jsdg

## Usage

In Jsdg Module you'll need to know only about the `Jsdg.build` function.
It has no arguments, all the interaction is made through the console
You'll need to type the title of the document, your FIO (**IN ENGLISH!!**), the title of the report (**AGAIN IN ENGLISH!!**) and full-paths to Java files (example: `D:\path\to\Exxample.java`)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
